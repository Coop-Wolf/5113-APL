variables must be capital
literals must be lowercase
    they can be in quotes and make capital


Example:

    code:
        woman(mia).
        woman(jody).

        loves(vincent, mia).
        loves(mike, mia).

    terminal:
        woman(jody).
        yes

        loves(vincent, mia).
        yes

Terms:
    Atoms - sequence of characters (string)
    Numbers
    Floats
    Variables - must start with uppercase (Ex: X, Y, Num)
    Complex terms - arguments, functor (Ex: playsAirGuitar(jody) loves(vincent, mia))
    Airty - Number of arguments a term has. (Ex: )
        Supports polymorphism - can have two predicates with same functor but differnt arity.
    Unification - instantiating woman(mia) with woman(X)
                - two terms unify if they are the same term or they contain variables that can be uniformily instantiated.
                - woman(mia) and woman(X) unify
    Instantiations -
